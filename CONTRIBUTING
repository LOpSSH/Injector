Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to Injector you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure your code compiles and the example project works without any issue. 
For that run `gradlew install` in injector directory and then build and run injector-android-example
